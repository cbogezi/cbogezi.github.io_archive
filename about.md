I perform interdisciplinary research on wildlife conservation issues, particularly human-carnivore coexistence.

### More Information

I am currently a graduate student at the [University of Washington-Seattle](http:/www.uw.edu) School of Environment and Forest Sciences [SEFS](http://www.cfr.washington.edu/). My lab advisor is Dr. John Marzluff.

In 2016, the Bullitt Foundation awarded me their 10th annual Environmental Leadership prize. The Bullitt prize is a huge honor for me and encourages me to continue investing in conservation, environment, and education.

The *Sunday Monitor* newspaper named me one of the "Top 40 Women Under 40" in my home country of Uganda.
